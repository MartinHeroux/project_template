abstract = {The purpose of the study was to determine how long humans could sustain the discharge of single motor units during a voluntary contraction. The discharge of motor units in first dorsal interosseus of subjects (27.8 ± 8.1 years old) was recorded for as long as possible. The task was terminated when the isolated motor unit stopped discharging action potentials, despite the ability of the individual to sustain the abduction force. Twenty-three single motor units were recorded. Task duration was 21.4 ± 17.8 min. When analysed across discharge duration, mean discharge rate (10.6 ± 1.8 pulses s(-1)) and mean abduction force (5.5 ± 2.8\% maximum) did not change significantly (discharge rate, P = 0.119; and abduction force, P = 0.235). In contrast, the coefficient of variation for interspike interval during the initial 30 s of the task was 22.2 ± 6.0\% and increased to 31.9 ± 7.0\% during the final 30 s (P < 0.001). All motor units were recruited again after 60 s of rest. Although subjects were able to sustain a relatively constant discharge rate, the cessation of discharge was preceded by a gradual increase in discharge variability. The findings also showed that the maximal duration of human motor unit discharge exceeds that previously reported for the discharge elicited in motor neurons by intracellular current injection in vitro.},
